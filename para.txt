The Online Voting System is a web-based application that allows users to cast their votes electronically through a simple interface. Instead of using paper ballots, voters can select their preferred candidate online and submit their choice instantly. The system automatically counts the votes and displays the results in real time, making the process faster, easier, and more transparent. It reduces manual errors, saves time, and ensures that the voting process is simple and accessible from anywhere. This project is designed mainly for learning purposes, to demonstrate how technology can be used to modernize traditional voting methods.
